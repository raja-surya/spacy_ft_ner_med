1. Create an AWS account (if not already ) and create a IAM user 'AWS'.

2. Assign permission AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess to the user AWS.

3. Create Access Key ID and Secret Access Key and download the csv (AWS_accessKeys.csv)

4. Run "aws configure" on cmd terminal, and give the access key id and secret.

5. Go to ECR (Elastic Container Service) and create a ECR Repository on AWS with the same name as the app "med_ner_fastapi". Keep "Visibility settings" as private and all other options untouched.

6. Click on the ECR repository and then follow "View push commands" to push the docker image 
to the ECR Repository.

We can skip "Build your Docker image using the following command." instruction as we have already built the docker image.

It will be like as follows:
   aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin .....
    
   docker tag med_ner_fastapi:latest <aws acc>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/med_ner_fastapi:latest
        
   docker images  <-- We should see the newly tagged image in the list.

   docker push <aws acc>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/med_ner_fastapi:latest
   
   The above push cmd will take few minutes.
   Once the push is completed, refresh the aws repository page. It will show the image.
   Copy and note down the URI of the image pushed, 
   like- <aws acc>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/med_ner_fastapi:latest


7. Go to App runner and create service.

    Select Repository type as "Container registry" and Provider as "Amazon ECR".
    Fill container image URI from that copied in step 6.
    Select ECR access role as AppRunnerECRAccessRole ( Create new service rule if it doesn't exist already ).
    Click Next.
    
8. Give service name. Port as 8080. You can leave other options as default values.
                                                      
9. Click on "Next and then "Create and deploy". This will take some time. Meanwhile you can monitor the logs.
                                                      
10. Once the service is successfully deployed, copy the Default domain URL - e.g https://w7mj8iqa55.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/ . If you open this URL in browser, you should see the Hello! page.

11. Edit the client app's code with this URL for for requests.post().
                                                      
12. Run the streamlit client app locally and test the NER app deployed on AWS App runner !
                                                      
13.   **** MOST IMPORTANT - DO NOT FORGET TO CLEANUP AWS SERVICES STARTED - YOU WILL BE CHARGED !!! ***               
    Delete the App runner service you created by clicking the Delete Action.
    Go to ECR and delete the repository created.
